# Mobile-App-Project
This is my course project from my Mobile Application Project that is for a baked goods company

On this application you can navigate using the panel or from the home page. There will be buttons that are linked to the other pages that the applciation offers.
There is a back button in the top left corner of the pages to help the users navigate back to where they started. 

Here is a link to see a preview of the application: http://sotd.us/shannonbenevides/Mod05-CP-MobApp/index_with_panel.html
